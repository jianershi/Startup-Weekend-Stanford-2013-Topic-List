# Github Page File Source
The static page file is generateed by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
The template is provided by [Jekyll Incorporated](incorporated.sendtoinc.com) under MIT license. 
The template has been modified several places to have ```{{ site:baseurl }}``` included in front of static file links. This is because this is not a user/organization github page but instead a project page. Several assumptions by the Jekyll template were thus not correct.
